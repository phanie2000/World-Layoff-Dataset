# World-Layoff-Dataset
This project analyzes a dataset of 2,362 company layoff records across multiple countries, industries, and funding stages using MySQL. The analysis explores patterns in workforce reductions, including total and percentage laid off, timing of layoffs, company stage, and funds raised.

# Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth MySQL-based analysis of global company layoffs during a period of major disruption in the labor market. The dataset contains 2,362 records spanning 51 countries, including the United States, Germany, China, and others, covering the years 2020 to 2023—a timeframe marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, which significantly reshaped employer–employee dynamics worldwide.

The analysis is implemented using two MySQL scripts:

1. Data Cleaning Script – focuses on standardizing fields, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency for accurate analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Script – examines layoff trends across countries, industries, company stages, and time.

Major global companies analyzed include Airbnb, Amazon, Uber, Carvana, Microsoft, Meta, and Google. Findings show that Google recorded the highest number of layoffs, with 12,000 employees laid off. The United States was the most affected country overall, accounting for 256,559 layoffs, while the customer service industry experienced the greatest impact by industry, with 45,182 employees laid off.

From a time-based perspective, 2023 recorded the highest number of layoffs, with 125,677 employees laid off, highlighting the delayed labor-market impact following the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for real-world data cleaning and exploratory analysis, while providing insights into how global economic shocks affect industries, companies, and employment patterns.
